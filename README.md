## 1. Description

**Product name**:
> CVStudio – Interactive desktop application for image processing with local neighborhood operators and feature-detection methods


**Context**:
> Bachelor’s thesis – “Development of an interactive desktop application for image processing with local neighborhood operators and feature-detection methods (SIFT, SURF, Hough, ORB) using CustomTkinter”



> CVStudio turns classic image processing and feature detection into an intuitive visual workflow. Instead of hand-coding every experiment, you can combine convolutions, point operations, and feature methods (including SIFT, SURF, Hough, ORB) into a pipeline you build and reorder via drag-and-drop.

> A live preview updates after each step. For rigorous comparisons, the built-in analysis module provides automatic evaluation with before/after views, revealing relationships faster and justifying parameter choices. Drop images directly onto the app, define custom filters, and reuse them across workflows. Automated tests keep processing chains reproducible.

**Target users**:
```
Students, computer-vision engineers, and researchers
```

**Key features**:
- Modular pipelines: Mix convolutions, point ops, and feature detectors/descriptors.
- Drag-and-drop UI: Import images, reorder steps, save workflows.
- Live preview & comparison: Immediate per-step rendering, before/after.
- Automatic analysis & tests: Quantitative/visual checks; reproducible runs.
- Custom filters: Plug in your own operators.
- Offline & local: No cloud; data stays on your machine.

**Platform & tech**:
```
Python 3.10.11, Windows desktop, CustomTkinter UI, fully offline
```

**Status & license**:
```
Beta v0.9.0; CC BY-NC 4.0 (non-commercial)
```

**Value**:
```
Less boilerplate, faster prototyping, clearer insights via live comparisons and automatic analysis
```
